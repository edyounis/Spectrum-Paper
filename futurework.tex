\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Bounds Check Bypass and Branch Target Injection Improvements}

While the replicated attacks are a PoC of a subset of speculative style attacks that BOOM
is susceptible to, future work can improve the secret leakage rate of the attacks.

One of the mechanisms to speed up both attacks is the improving the hand-made L1 cache line flush function
used. The current implementation uses a large extra array that is indexed into to evict a particular
cache set. Another approach, would be to just have this extra array be the size of the L1 cache and use
arithmetic to figure out which entry to index into to evict the requested cache line. This decreases the
amount of extra memory needed to run the function while allowing the statically allocated array to reside
at any memory location. Additionally, another approach to speeding up the function is to know where the
secret and probed array reside in memory. This allows the function to predetermine which addresses can be 
accessed to evict any particular line in the cache instead of doing arithmetic to index into the extra array and
having multiple branches that may misspeculate.

In addition to improving the cache line flush function, another
improvement can be to tweak the different attack parameters. This includes
the attack parameters listed in \ref{tab:attack-params}. Potentially, the amount of rounds on the
same byte and training rounds can be reduced to improve the speed of the attack.
These can be adjusted in conjunction with the cache flush hits on the same set so even though the 
random cache replacement policy may not clear all the ways of the set, the amount of rounds on
the same byte might remove the false hits when the specified line was not evicted.

\subsection{Other Attacks and More BOOM Configurations}

In addition to the two attacks that were implemented, BOOM is susceptible to a variety of
other speculative style attacks. One such example is the RSB attack, which our team was 
originally planning on implementing. However, due to BOOM not have a working configuration
with the RSB at the time, this attack was not implemented in liew of implementing the Branch Target
Injection attack. By fixing the RSB, the team could work on implementing this attack with the 
code that was initially created for it. Another improvement to the project would be to train the
variety of attacks on different branch predictors. Since BOOM provides a mechanism to add branch 
predictors and it already has a TAGE predictor, future work can use this functionality to determine
the speed of the attacks based these new predictors.

\subsection{Further Evaluations}

Use HPM counters to determine the exact amount of loads that are speculated, delayed, etc. They are
attached to RTL signals so anything can be measured. They just require a bugfix

More benchmarks including running the full SPEC suite and other memory intensive workloads. [MAYBE
coremark if it cannot be done]

Get better synthesis data from HAMMER [?]. Instead of using flops use sram to have a minimal 
physical impact.

\subsection{BOOM Improvements}

Future work for the project also involves bringing BOOM to a more stable version. Throughout
the project, a multitude of bugs were found both in the front-end (fetch stage, BPU, etc) and the 
load/store unit that the team had to work around. With these fixed, not only will performance
of the core improve, but other replication and modifications to the core will be easier since
the base core will be stable.
