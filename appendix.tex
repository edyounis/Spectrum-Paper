\section{Bounds Check Bypass BOOM Proof of Concept}

In \ref{code:boom-spectre-v1} is the implementation of the Bound Check Bypass attack
on BOOM. Without speculation, the array2 access in the victimFunc would be only accessed
during the training round. However, since speculation occurs, the array2 is accessed with
the secret value during the attacker run.
