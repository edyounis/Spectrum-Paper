          Bounds Check Bypass BOOM Proof of Concept}

In \ref{code:boom-spectre-v1} is the implementation of the Bound Check Bypass attack
on BOOM. Without speculation, the {\tt array2} access in the {\tt victimFunc} would be only accessed
during the training round. However, since speculation occurs, the {\tt array2} is accessed with
the secret value during the attacker run.
