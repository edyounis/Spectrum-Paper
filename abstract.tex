    %TODO: update the scores for Dhrystone
    %TODO: does the last sentence sound good

    With the discovery of speculative execution exploitative attacks, the computer
    architecture community is rethinking the architecture boundary and how to 
    mitigate attacks while keeping performance at an acceptable level.
    In this paper, we present three different results;
    a taxonomy for speculative style attacks and defenses, replication of 
    speculative attacks on an open-source processor, and a simple speculative 
    buffer cache that mitigates the basic speculative cache attacks.
    
    We have categorized the variety of attacks based on if the attacks are 
    architecturally legal and the defenses based on their types. Additionally, 
    we have mapped mitigations to the attacks that they potentially cover.
    Using the Berkeley Out-Of-Order Machine (BOOM), we have 
    re-implemented Spectre Variants 1 and 2 that target the L1 Data Cache. We 
    achieve a leakage rate of around 114 bytes per sec with a 100MHz processor 
    frequency. Additionally, we propose and implement a speculative buffer,
    called SpecBuf, that holds speculative data in the MSHRs until commit where the 
    data will be transfered to the L1. Based on preliminary results, it achieves 
    a [TODO: DHRYSTONE SCORE] score on the Dhrystone benchmark
    resulting in a [TODO: PERC DIFFERENCE]\% performance decrease compared to the
    baseline. Additionally, synthesizing around a 45nm process shows a 3\% area
    increase and 3\% lower clock impact. To our knowledge, these replications and 
    SpecBuf implementation is the first demonstration of a speculative style attack
    on BOOM and the first synthesizable RTL implementation of a speculative buffer.
