\section{Introduction}

Ever since the disclosure of Spectre and Meltdown at the beginning of 2018, there has
been a large number of attacks targeting speculative microarchitectural state in
out-of-order processors \cite{b1,b2}. Each of these attacks is able to exploit the shared
state of the processor between a victim process/thread and a malicious process/thread.
While classifications have been developed for cache-based and for timing-based 
side-channel attacks \cite{b5,b6,b7,b9,b10}, a general taxonomy for these attacks has not been adopted.
A well-devised taxonomy would inform not only the 
categorization of new attacks but also the development of hardware mitigations for 
these attacks. A complete categorization system would help hardware researchers 
identify general mitigations for broad categories of vulnerabilities, instead of 
targeted fixes for specific attacks. Additionally, the Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine (BOOM) open-source RISC-V
microarchitecture has not been exposed to these types of attacks yet \cite{b11}. BOOM
is a generic implementation of a speculative 
out-of-order microarchitecture that employs many of the same features as the 
proprietary systems targeted by published attacks. Generic, open-source 
implementations of attacks and their mitigation strategies would provide a common 
foundation for the development of defenses for speculative execution attacks.
By attacking an open-source machine with Spectre, researchers can not only gain more 
insight into the malicious attack but also attempt to mitigate the attack on a shared,
open platform. Moreover, this project is hoped to unify and guide the attack 
mitigation process. With an attack taxonomy and an open-source microarchitecture, a 
newly proposed mitigation technique can easily target a class of attacks as informed 
by the taxonomy.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we discuss
related works that indicate relevant work that introduces attacks, defenses, and classifications.
In Section 3 we discuss our taxonomy and how we think about the attacks and defenses. In
Section 4 we present the subset of attacks that were replicated for this paper. In Section 5
we discuss the implementation of the SpecBuf. In Section 6 we discuss the evaluation of the
replications and the SpecBuf. In Section 7 we discuss future work that can be done with each
component and conclude in Section 8.
