\section{Conclusion}

With the large influx of speculative style attacks being revealed, this paper categorizes,
replicates and mitigates a subset of the attacks. We have categorized different attacks 
and defenses based on their type, architectural legality, and targets. We have replicated 
Spectre on the Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine, an open source RV64G processor and showed 
that it is also susceptible to speculative style attacks. Finally, a Speculative Buffer 
was created as a basic mitigation for these cache side channel based speculative attacks.

Our hope is that with this work, future security work with BOOM can continue with this 
work as a basis. Additionally, we hope that the taxonomy created will make it easier
for researchers to understand the variants of the attacks and create a platform for others
to add to.
