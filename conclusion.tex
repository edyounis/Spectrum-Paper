\section{Conclusion}

With the large influx of speculative style attacks being revealed, this paper categorizes,
replicates and mitigates a subset of the attacks. We have categorized different attacks 
and defenses based on their type, architectural legality, and targets. We have replicated 
Spectre on the Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine, an open source RV64G processor and showed 
that it is also susceptible to speculative style attacks. Finally, a speculative buffer 
was created as a basic mitigation for these cache side channel based speculative attacks.

Our hope is that with this work, future security research will work with BOOM to expand
its capabilities and find more security flaws. Additionally, we hope that the taxonomy
created will make it easier for researchers to understand the variants of the attacks
and create an easy layout for other attacks and defenses to be added to.
