\section{Conclusion} \label{Conclusion}

With the large influx of speculative style attacks being revealed, this paper categorizes,
replicates and mitigates a subset of the attacks. We have categorized different attacks 
and defenses based on their type, architectural legality, and targets. We have replicated 
Spectre on the Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine, an open source RV64G processor, showing that it
is useful as a baseline for secure hardware research. Finally, a speculative buffer was demonstrated
as a basic mitigation for these cache side channel based speculative attacks.

Our hope is that with this work, we have demonstrated how future security research may utilize BOOM.
Additionally, we hope that the taxonomy created will make it easier for researchers to understand
the variants of the attacks and the relations between various defenses and attack mechanisms.
