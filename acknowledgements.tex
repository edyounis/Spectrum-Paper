\section{Acknowledgements}

We would like to thank Chris Celio for helping the group 
get started on the project with his thoughts on hardware mitigations for
Spectre attacks, and, of course, for building BOOM.
Additionally, we would like to thank the ADEPT lab and the FireSim
team for providing the necessary tools and resources for emulate the attacks and 
microbenchmarks.
